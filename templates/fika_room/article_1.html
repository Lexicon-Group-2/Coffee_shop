        <p>The coffee flavor you get to taste in your cup, is the result of every single step taken between the time the
          coffee was harvested to the time you opened the pack and brewed it (including the brewing process).

          The taste(s) is perceived via the taste buds. Each and every one of us perceives them slightly differently due
          to many factors & habits that affect our taste buds (smoking, drinking, type of food we normally consume,
          etc). The basic 5 tastes everyone tends to be able to perceive are: bitterness, ,acidity, sweetness, saltiness
          and body..</p>
        <p><b>Bitterness</b>, the taste most people associate coffee with. The truth is that coffee has some bitter
          components (caffeine for starters) and the melanoidins that get created during the roasting process, but keep
          in mind that coffee if roasted & brewed properly does not have to be bitter.</p><br>

        <p><b>Acidity –</b> the taste that makes coffee have a certain vividness or sparkle. Acidity is what makes
          coffee to not taste flat. Acidity is the element that makes the coffee have a hint of lemon, wine, or even
          pineapple & fruity taste.</p><br>

        <p><b>Sweetness-</b> as well as saltiness can be the sugary or salty taste which you know from normal sugar &
          salt. Both these tastes could appear in very different levels, prompting you to perceive them merely as hints.
        </p>

        <p>The body or mouth feel is definitely not a flavor but most probably a sensation. It refers to the texture and
          heaviness of the coffee on your tongue and mouth. It’s a feeling rather than anything else you get with the
          1st sip of coffee.
